Build a global literary culture rooted in curiosity, integrity, and meaningful conversation.

- **Curiosity** — Intellectual exploration without boundaries
- **Intellectual Courage** — Challenging ideas, difficult conversations
- **Depth Over Novelty** — Substance before trends

### 10.3 Brand Governance
- **Brand Guardian:** Designated team member for consistency
- **Monthly Reviews:** Audit new materials
- **Quarterly Updates:** Refine guidelines as needed
- **Annual Assessment:** Major revisions if required

### 10.4 Mandatory Usage & Exceptions
- **Universal Adoption:** Every asset—digital, print, environmental—must reference this document before production. No ad-hoc palettes, fonts, or messaging may be introduced downstream.
- **Change Requests:** Teams can propose additions or exceptions, but they must submit rationale, mockups, and impact analysis to the Brand Guardian for approval before public release.
- **Documentation:** Approved deviations are logged with version numbers and expiration dates so they can be folded into future updates or retired.
- **Audit Trail:** When adjustments are made, record which sections of the guidelines were referenced to maintain accountability and continuity for new collaborators.

### 10.5 Digital Implementation Toolkit
- **Design Tokens:** `/Elivate Design Tokens.css` is the single source of truth for color, typography, spacing, and elevation values. Import these tokens directly into any styling pipeline rather than redefining values per project.
- **Tailwind Configuration:** `/tailwind.config.js` mirrors the token set for utility-first builds. Extend this file—do not override base primitives—to keep implementations consistent across apps.
- **Component Libraries:** When using external UI kits, map their variables to our tokens first. Components that cannot conform should be rebuilt with Tailwind utilities or custom CSS grounded in the token file.
- **Version Control:** Treat both the token stylesheet and Tailwind config as governed assets. Pull requests modifying them require review from the Brand Guardian and the Technical Administrator.
